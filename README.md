Welcome to the **Image Recreation Using Genetic Algorithm** project! This application demonstrates the power of genetic algorithms by evolving binary images to closely resemble a target image. Featuring a Django-powered web interface with real-time updates via **Django Channels**, users can interact with the algorithm in a seamless and dynamic environment. It also highlights optimization techniques inspired by natural evolution.

## üìú Overview

This project leverages **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to reconstruct a predefined target image from a random population of binary (black-and-white) images. By employing techniques like selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm iteratively evolves toward a solution.  

With the Django web interface, users can upload target images and monitor real-time updates of the evolution process via **WebSockets**, powered by **Django Channels**.  

### Key Highlights:
- **Real-Time Updates**: View generation progress instantly via WebSockets.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Matches the generated image to the target based on pixel similarity.
- **Tournament Selection**: Selects parents for producing the next generation.
- **Uniform Crossover**: Combines traits from two parents to create offspring.
- **Mutation**: Introduces randomness to maintain diversity.
- **Replacement Strategy**: Ensures progressive evolution through generations.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Details  

This project utilizes a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of binary images, gradually improving them to match a target image. The process involves several key steps:  

1. **Initialization**: A population of random binary images is created, with each pixel representing a gene (0 or 1). These images serve as the starting point for the algorithm.

     <img src="./Screenshots/initialization.png" alt="Initialization" width="300">
   </div>  

2. **Fitness Evaluation**: The fitness of each image is evaluated by comparing it to the target image. The algorithm counts the number of pixels in the population that match the corresponding pixels in the target, and this number is used as the fitness score.  
   <div align="center">
     <img src="./Screenshots/fitness.png" alt="Fitness Evaluation" width="300">
   </div>  

3. **Selection**: Tournament selection is applied to choose parent images based on their fitness. A subset of individuals is selected at random, and the one with the highest fitness in this subset is chosen to act as a parent.  
   <div align="center">
     <img src="./Screenshots/selection.png" alt="Selection" width="500">
   </div>  

4. **Crossover**: Parents are combined using uniform crossover, where traits (pixels) from each parent are mixed according to a random mask. This introduces genetic variation by blending features from the parent images.  
   <div align="center">
     <img src="./Screenshots/crossover.png" alt="Crossover" width="300">
   </div>  

5. **Mutation**: To further promote diversity, a small percentage of pixels in the offspring are flipped. This mutation introduces random changes to the images, helping to avoid premature convergence.  
   <div align="center">
     <img src="./Screenshots/mutation.png" alt="Mutation" width="300">
   </div>  

6. **Replacement**: The old population is replaced by the new generation of offspring. This allows the algorithm to progress toward the target image over multiple iterations.  
   <div align="center">
     <img src="./Screenshots/replacement.png" alt="Replacement" width="300">
   </div>  

7. **Convergence**: These steps are repeated for several generations, with the population gradually evolving to closely match the target image. The process continues until a satisfactory solution is found.
