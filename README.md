Welcome to the **Image Recreation Using Genetic Algorithm** project! This application demonstrates the power of genetic algorithms by evolving binary images to closely resemble a target image. Featuring a Django-powered web interface with real-time updates via **Django Channels**, users can interact with the algorithm in a seamless and dynamic environment. It also highlights optimization techniques inspired by natural evolution.

## üìú Overview

This project leverages **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to reconstruct a predefined target image from a random population of binary (black-and-white) images. By employing techniques like selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm iteratively evolves toward a solution.  

With the Django web interface, users can upload target images and monitor real-time updates of the evolution process via **WebSockets**, powered by **Django Channels**.  

### Key Highlights:
- **Real-Time Updates**: View generation progress instantly via WebSockets.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Matches the generated image to the target based on pixel similarity.
- **Tournament Selection**: Selects parents for producing the next generation.
- **Uniform Crossover**: Combines traits from two parents to create offspring.
- **Mutation**: Introduces randomness to maintain diversity.
- **Replacement Strategy**: Ensures progressive evolution through generations.

## üìñ Usage

1. Set your desired target image:
   - Replace the default target image (`target.png`) in the project directory.

2. Customize algorithm parameters:
   - Modify `population_size`, `mutation_rate`, and `num_generations` in `config.py`.

3. Run the algorithm:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Observe the evolution:
   - Check the `output` directory for the final image and generation progress.
